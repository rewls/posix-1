= POSIX.1-2017

* POSIX.1-2017 is simultaneously IEEE Std 1003.1â„¢-2017 and The Open Group
  Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7.

'''

* POSIX.1-2017 defines a standard operating system interface and environment,
  including a command interpreter (or "shell"), and common utility programs to
  support applications portability at the source code level.
* POSIX.1-2017 is intended to be used by both application developers and
  system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an
  associated volume):
** General terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this
   standard, including utility conventions and C-language header definitions,
   are included in the Base Definitions volume.
** Definitions for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific
   system services for the C programming language, function issues, including
   portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the System
   Interfaces volume.
** Definitions for a standard source code-level interface to command
   interpretation services (a "shell") and common utility programs for
   application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume.
** Extended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document
   structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of
   POSIX.1-2017 and why features were included or discarded by the standard
   developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume.

* The following areas are outside the scope of POSIX.1-2017:
** Graphics interfaces
** Database management system interfaces
** Record I/O considerations
** Object or binary code portability
** System configuration and resource availability

* POSIX.1-2017 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are
  of importance to application developers, rather than the internal
  construction techniques employed to achieve these capabilities.
* Special emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities that are needed
  in a wide variety of commercial applications.
